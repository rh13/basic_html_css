          The hype for Avengers Infinity War was truly real. The expectations were to the roof with this one, but I'm afraid we all did a huge mistake on what to expect. Can a 150 minute movie deliver on the level of these expectations and hype? Well it can't, but this movie does it's best.This film is completely different than any other MCU film, and any other film in general, and you will find that out when you see it for yourself.   </h4>

<p class="wrap">It's impossible for this title to remain at 9.5/10, and do not trust this number. Batman v Superman started at 9.8 as well, and we know where it ended up. Really, I think most of the fans will like it A LOT, but the score will drop A LOT once the movie opens in the US and China. Most of the votes now, come from people who have not even seen the movie yet.</p>
