	<p id="story">As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain. Written by Marvel Studios</p><br><br>

	<h2 id="ureview">User Review</h2>
	<h4 id="review">The hype for Avengers Infinity War was truly real. The expectations were to the roof with this one, but I'm afraid we all did a huge mistake on what to expect. Can a 150 minute movie deliver on the level of these expectations and hype? Well it can't, but this movie does it's best.This film is completely different than any other MCU film, and any other film in general, and you will find that out when you see it for yourself. You must be happy to see your favourite character even for 5 minutes in this movie, that's one of the necessary cons of the mix, and we shouldn't expected more in the first place.The movie lacks basic plot development. That'sFORTUNATELY not a very bad thing in the end of the day. In general, the movie delivers what a 150 minute movie with 20+ main cast can deliver. The consequences were unexpected, and shocking, and the Russo brother did their best. I'm sure if you go to see he movie with low expectations you will enjoy it a hell more. 9.5/10 After rewatching this movie I will change my vote from 8 to 9.5.</h4>

 
   <h3 id="dotted_border"> *It's impossible for this title to remain at 9.5/10, and do not trust this number. Batman v Superman started at 9.8 as well, and we know where it ended up. Really, I think most of the fans will like it A LOT, but the score will drop A LOT once the movie opens in the US and China. Most of the votes now, come from people who have not even seen the movie yet.</h3>

   <h4 id="borderimg1">Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.</h4>
   
   <h4 id="borderimg2">In December 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that Infinity War was the most anticipated film of 2018.[149] In March 2018, early box office projections had Infinity War grossing between $200–235 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada and between $490–590 million for its total domestic gross.[150] Fandango reported that Infinity War achieved the largest initial 24-hour ticket pre-sales for a superhero film in just six hours, surpassing the record from Black Panther. Atom Tickets also reported that Infinity War sold more tickets in its first pre-sales day than Black Panther sold in its first month.[151] Within 72 hours, the film became the biggest amount of pre-sales for any superhero film at AMC Theatres.</h4>
